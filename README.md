# Pokergraphic Memory!
"Pokergraphic Memory!" is both a powerful and memory training tool and a fun recall game. This project utilises the incredible techniques of the ancient "Loci" system, and the "PAO" system to help users memorise and recall the order of an entire deck of 52 cards; a feat many people would think impossible. This is the same set of techniques that memory athletes use to perform unbelievable cognitive achievements such as recalling Pi to 67,890 digits.
